First up, you need a Github account. You already have one of those right? Great.

To get started you can just fork this repository to your account, then simply rename it so it starts with your github username, not mine (mines nternetinspired, your's is something else).

A few minutes later (up to 10 apparently) Github will be serving your site up at yourusername.github.com. Sorted.

##How do I change stuff?

<p data-pullquote="…to use Disqus comments you need to have set up a Disqus account…">Easy stuff first. Site-wide configuration junk is stored in the configuration file, _config.yml. Edit that inserting your name, site name, email address, etc.</p>

If you are going to use Disqus comments you need to have set up a Disqus account (obviously) and you can then place the username in this file to. At that point Disqus comment trickery will automagically appear in your posts. If a comments box appears, but commenting does not load you should check you have everything set up correctly at Disqus.
